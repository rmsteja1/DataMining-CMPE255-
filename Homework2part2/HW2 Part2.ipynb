Each dataset contains \"buckets\" of bike rentals. Each row corresponds to an hour in the month. For example, row 1 of the February dataset corresponds to bike rentals starting on February 1st 12AM-1AM. The columns where the value is \"True\" correspond to the bike rental starting locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. \n","\n","If your SJSU ID ends in an odd number, pick the February dataset. Otherwise, pick the March dataset.\n","\n","Perform the following tasks on the provided bike rental dataset. Complete all the LP questions to receive a \"low pass\" grade on the homework. Complete all the questions (both LP and HP) to receive a \"high pass\" grade on the homework. \n","\n","Note that if you are unable to complete any of the LP questions satisfactorily, you will receive a grade of \"revision required\". You can revise and resubmit your work in exchange for a token. Please review the syllabus for more information on specifications grading.\n","\n","**VERY IMPORTANT**: Include **ALL** the references you used for this assignment, including names of classmates you discuss with. Failure to cite your sources counts as an act of academic dishonesty and will be taken seriously without zero tolerance. You will automatically receive a “fail” grade in the homework and further serious penalties may be imposed.\n","\n","NOTE: You can look for help on the Internet but refrain from referencing too much. Please cite all your sources in your submission. \n","When you submit your assignment, you automatically agree to the following statement. If you do not agree, it is your responsibility to provide the reason.\n","\n","“*I affirm that I have neither given nor received unauthorized help in completing this homework.
